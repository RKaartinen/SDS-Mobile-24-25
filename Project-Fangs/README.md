FANGS! Road to Power
Fangs is a vampire themed clicker-game of my own creating. Heavy inspiration are from V-Rising, Pou and INTTI denssi-clicker.

How to Play
Your main task is to help Fangs - our vampire character - to level up and evolve by clicking three buttons; Study, Drink and Decide. Clicking Study button increases your Wisdom, clicking Decide button increases your Authority and clicking Drink button increases the Thirst bar.
Thirst bar decreases every time you Study or Decide, and after Thirst is below 30 you get only 1/2 of the exp. After thirst bar is below 15 you only get 1/4 exp. So don't let Fangs go thirsty!
Every tenth level you evolve, which requires clicking evolve button. 
Evolving to level 30, requires Authority and Wisdom to be level 25 each. Evolving to level 50, requires Authority and Wisdom to be level 50 each.
The game is fairly short and ends once everything is level 50.
