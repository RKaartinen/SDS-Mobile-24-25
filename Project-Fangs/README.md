# FANGS! Road to Power 🦇

**Fangs!** is a vampire themed clicker-game of my own creating. Heavy inspiration are from *V-Rising*, *Pou* and *INTTI denssi-clicker*.

## 🕹️ How to Play
Your main task is to help **Fangs** - our vampire character - to level up and evolve by clicking three buttons:

- 🔍 **Study** → Increases your **Wisdom**
- ⚖️ **Decide** → Increases your **Authority**
- 🍷 **Drink** → Increases the **Thirst bar**

### 🩸 Thirst Mechanism

- Thirst **decreases** every time you **Study** or **Decide**
- If Thirst is **below 30**, you gain only **½ EXP**
- If Thirst is **below 15**, you gain only **¼ EXP**

    *-Don't let Fangs go thirsty!*

### 🧛 Evolving

You evolve every **10 levels**, by clicking the **Evolve** button.

- Evolving to **level 30** requires **Authority 25** and **Wisdom 25**
- Evolving to **level 50** requires **Authority 50** and **Wisdom 50**

The game is fairly short and ends once everything reaches **level 50**.
